Summary: Discussed about the overall project process in details and how each member is contributing to the prototype. Jesse came check-in the meeting, and we were able to ask questions we had confusions about, such as "How do we avoid getting grade decreases in our prototype." Everyone went and learned React Native tutorials. Discuss the specifications for the front end. 

Accomplishments from last week: Everyone was able to finish initiate React Native environment following a YouTube tutorial using React Native. During the process, we researched about the technical advantages and disadvantages of using React Native Web comparing to other programing platforms such React Native XP.

Summary: To implement our backend and handle requests from our front end, we have java with spring boot to support api calls. THe backend server is deployed to heroku and calls to the endpoints serve json reponses. Our deadline is extended by the voting in today's class, hence, our deadline is extended to after Spring Break. By next week, we mean next week not including Spring Break, so everything will be due for review 3/26/18.


Accomplishments from last week: 
Kenny: Created transactions and cryptocoin endpoints so that front end can make restful calls to access user information as well as deployed the backend server to heroku. Also created in memory databases as a temporary solution.
Alex: Polish and update transaction history in MERN, however, we're using Java as our backend.
Rych: Update landing page front end and update charts page.

Task assigned for next week 3/26/18:
